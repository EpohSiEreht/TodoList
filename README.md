# TodoList
A bare bone Todo list application using ES6, React, Webpack, Sass, and Axios

### How to run:

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm start
4. If url doesn't automatically open, Go to http://localhost:8080

### Notes:

1. www.mockapi.io is being used as a mockup api for quick back-end implementation. It's free and easy to set up.
2. NPM is configured to immediately open localhost:8080 on Mac computers, but it takes a few seconds to bundle up everything.
3. If any changes are saved, the page will reload with the updated changes.
4. Axios is promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It wraps the http requests using a polyfill for ES6 new promise syntax.
